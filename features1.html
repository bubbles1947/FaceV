            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Face detection and recognition technologies have become an integral part of modern applications, 
                ranging from security systems to social media platforms. Here, we explore the features, accuracy, 
                and benefits of two prominent models: Haar Cascades and RetinaFace (with ArcFace for recognition).

            <h2>Haar Cascades</h2>
            <p>
                Haar Cascades, developed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones, are one of the earliest and most widely 
                used algorithms for face detection. These are based on the concept of detecting patterns using 
                cascading classifiers.
